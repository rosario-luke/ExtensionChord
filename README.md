ExtensionChord
========

ExtensionChord is an Android application for creating collaborative geolocation based music playlists. Users can use the app to create "Music Rooms", that other users can see and join if they are within 0.5 km of the music room. Together the users can add songs from music provider SoundCloud  to create a playlist, which can then be played off of the room creator's phone. The app also leverages a voting mechanism to allow a quorum of users to decide if a song should be skipped. The application is written in Java and uses Parse as a cloud data provider.
